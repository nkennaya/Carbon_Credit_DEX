- Projects must include type (e.g., "renewable", "capture"), location, vintage year, and methodology.

### 2. **Credit Issuance**
- Requires verifier role.
- AI confidence score ≥ 80% and verification hash are required.
- Credits are issued as:
  - NFT for batch identity
  - Fungible tokens for trade and retirement
